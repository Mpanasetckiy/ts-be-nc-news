# Northcoders News API TypeScript

It is the API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as Reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture

## Installation

To set up the local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mpanasetckiy/be-nc-news.git
   ```

2. You will need to create two `.env` files for your project: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Into each, add `PGDATABASE=`, with the correct database name for that environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names). Double check that these `.env` files are `.gitignored`.

3. You'll need to run npm install at this point.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. You'll need to create dev database and test database running the following command:

   ```
   npm run setup-dbs
   ```

5. After installing dependencies and creating the databases, you'll need to seed db with the following command:

   ```
   npm run seed
   ```
